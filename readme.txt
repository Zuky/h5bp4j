
H5BP4J - Simple Joomla responsive template based on HTML5 Boilerplate

This Joomla template is based on an awesome project called HTML5 Boilerplate, which thanks to Paul Irish, .... and others created
 very good starting point for any web project. 
Keep in mind that our H5BP4J template is very basic, and should be treated as a starting point for someone who knows CSS, HTML and a little bit of PHP and is trying to create his own template.
